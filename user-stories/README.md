# User Stories

This directory contains the core user stories for the ALX Airbnb Project.

Each user story was written based on the use case diagram created in Task 1. The purpose of these stories is to describe how different users interact with the system from their perspective.

## Purpose

User stories help the development team understand:
- What features are needed
- Why they matter to the user
- How to prioritize development work

## File Structure

- `user-stories.md` â€“ A list of key user stories that reflect the main interactions in the system.

## Example
